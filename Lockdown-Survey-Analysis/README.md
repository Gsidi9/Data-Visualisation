# Lockdown-Spending-Saving

The objective of this project is to know whether participants saved more money or spent more money during the UK government lockdown. The UK government lockdown rules were requiring people to stay at home, except for very limited purposes, closing certain businesses and venues. 
This was to explore how participants handled their money and what areas they either saved or spent that money.
